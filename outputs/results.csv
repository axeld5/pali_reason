Question: At time $t=0$ a tank contains $Q_0 \mathrm{lb}$ of salt dissolved in 100 gal of water; see Figure 2.3.1. Assume that water containing $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{lb}$ of salt/gal is entering the tank at a rate of $r \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min}$ and that the well-stirred mixture is draining from the tank at the same rate. Set up the initial value problem that describes this flow process. By finding the amount of salt $Q(t)$ in the tank at any time, and the limiting amount $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time, if $r=3$ and $Q_0=2 Q_L$, find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \%$ of $Q_L$.","

Question: One of the most dramatic videos on the web (but entirely fictitious) supposedly shows a man sliding along a long water slide and then being launched into the air to land in a water pool. Let's attach some reasonable numbers to such a flight to calculate the velocity with which the man would have hit the water. Figure indicates the launch and landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate system with its origin conveniently located at the launch site. From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as $D=20.0 \mathrm{~m}$, the flight time as $t=2.50 \mathrm{~s}$, and the launch angle as $\theta_0=40.0^{\circ}$. Find the magnitude of the velocity at launch and at landing.","
