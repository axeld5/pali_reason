Question: At time $t=0$ a tank contains $Q_0 \mathrm{lb}$ of salt dissolved in 100 gal of water; see Figure 2.3.1. Assume that water containing $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{lb}$ of salt/gal is entering the tank at a rate of $r \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min}$ and that the well-stirred mixture is draining from the tank at the same rate. Set up the initial value problem that describes this flow process. By finding the amount of salt $Q(t)$ in the tank at any time, and the limiting amount $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time, if $r=3$ and $Q_0=2 Q_L$, find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \%$ of $Q_L$."," The initial value problem is given by the differential equation $\frac{dQ}{dt}=\frac{1}{4} Q$, with initial condition $Q(0)=Q_0$. The solution to this differential equation is $Q(t)=Q_0 e^{\frac{1}{4} t}$. The limiting amount $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time is given by $Q_L=Q_0 e^{\frac{1}{4} t}$. To find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \%$ of $Q_L$, we need to find the time $T$ such that $Q(T)=Q_0 e^{\frac{1}{4} t} \approx Q_0 e^{\frac{1}{4} T}$. This is equivalent to $Q_0 e^{\frac{1}{4} T}=Q_0 e^{\frac{1}{4} t}$, which simplifies to $e^{\frac{1}{4} T}=e^{\frac{1}{4} t}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $\frac{1}{4} T=\frac{1}{4} t$, which simplifies to $T=t$. Therefore, the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \%$ of $Q_L$ is $T=t$.",130.4

Since $m∠ACB = 55°$, we have $m∠ACB = \frac{55°}{2} = 27.5°$.
Since $m∠ACB = 27.5°$, we have $m∠ACB = \frac{27.5°}{2} = 13.75°$.
Since $m∠ACB = 13.75°$, we have $m∠ACB = \frac{13.75°}{2} = 6.875°$.

Question: 如图，在Rt△ABC中，∠BAC＝90°，以Rt△ABC的三边为边分别向外作等边三角形△A'BC，△AB'C，△ABC'，若△A'BC，△AB'C的面积分别是10和4，则△ABC'的面积是（）
Choices:
(A) 4
(B) 6
(C) 8
(D) 9"," Let's denote the area of △ABC as A, the area of △A'BC as A', and the area of △AB'C as A''. We are given that A' = 10 and A'' = 4.

Since △A'BC is a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length A' and a side of length B', we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of △ABC.

A'^2 + B'^2 = A^2
10^2 + B'^2 = 10^2
B'^2 = 10^2 - 10^2
B'^2 = 0
B' = 0

Since B' = 0, the area of △ABC is 0.

Now, let's find the area of △AB'C.

A' = 10
B' = 0
C = 4

Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we have:

A = (1/2) * B' * C
A = (1/2) * 0 * 4
A = 0

Since the area of △ABC is 0, the area of △AB'C is also 0.

Now, let's find the area of △ABC'.

A = 0
B = 0
C = 4

Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we have:

A = (1/2) * B * C
0 = (1/2) * 0 * 4
0 = 0

Since the area of △ABC is 0, the area of △ABC' is also 0.

Therefore, the correct option is:

Question: Consider the following matrices:
$$
\mathbf{A}=\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & 3 & 1 \\
2 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{B}=\left(\begin{array}{rrr}

2 & 1 \\
4 & 3 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right)
$$
Find $|\mathbf{A B}|$."," First, we find the determinant of $\mathbf{A}$:
\[\det(\mathbf{A}) = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 = 3 - 4 - 0 = -1.\]
Next, we find the determinant of $\mathbf{B}$:
\[\det(\mathbf{B}) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 0 \cdot 3 = 2 - 0 - 0 = 2.\]
Finally, we find the determinant of $\mathbf{A B}$:
\[\det(\mathbf{A B}) = \det(\mathbf{A}) \cdot \det(\mathbf{B}) = (-1) \cdot 2 = -2.\]
Therefore, $|\mathbf{A B}| = -2$.

Question: Jeffrey is the proud owner of an eclectic bow tie collection. He keeps track of how many bow ties he has, and organizes them by pattern and material. What is the probability that a randomly selected bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of velvet? Simplify any fractions.'"," Let A be the event ""the bow tie is designed with swirls"" and B be the event ""the bow tie is made of velvet"".
To find the probability that a bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of velvet, first identify the sample space and the event.
The outcomes in the sample space are the different bow ties. Each bow tie is equally likely to be selected, so this is a uniform probability model.
The event is A and B, ""the bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of velvet"".
Since this is a uniform probability model, count the number of outcomes in the event A and B and count the total number of outcomes. Then, divide them to compute the probability.
Find the number of outcomes in the event A and B.
A and B is the event ""the bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of velvet"", so look at the table to see how many bow ties are designed with swirls and are made of velvet.
The number of bow ties that are designed with swirls and are made of velvet is 3.
Find the total number of outcomes.
Add all the numbers in the table to find the total number of bow ties.
5 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 14
Find P(A and B).
Since all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event A and B is the number of outcomes in event A and B divided by the total number of outcomes.
P(A and B) = \frac{# of outcomes in A and B}{total # of outcomes}
 = \frac{3}{14}
The probability that a bow tie is designed with swirls and is made of velvet is \frac{3}{14}.",0.21

Find the perimeter of $LMPQ$
Choices:
(A) 10
(B) 40
(C) 70
(D) 140"," Let's think about the multi-choice question.
$m \angle Q L M=2 x^{2}-10$
$m \angle Q P M=8 x$
$M P=10$
$m \angle Q=m \angle Q P+m \angle L M$
$8 x=2 x^{2}-10$
$2 x^{2}-8 x-10=0$
$x=\frac{8+\sqrt{64+40}}{4}=\frac{8+\sqrt{104}}{4}=\frac{8+10.1}{4}=\frac{18.1}{4}=4.5$
$m \angle Q=4.5$
$m \angle Q P=8 x=8 \times 4.5=36$
$m \angle L=m \angle Q=4.5$
$m \angle P=m \angle Q=4.5$
$m \angle L M=m \angle L=4.5$

Now, let's find the distance between the ship and the lighthouse at the moment the ship reaches point B. Since the ship sails at a speed of 60 nautical miles per hour in the direction of 60 degrees from north by west, we can calculate the distance as follows:

$d = 60 * t$

Now, we can find the angle $\angle BAP$ using the tangent function. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is the distance between the ship and the lighthouse, and the adjacent side is the distance the ship has traveled.

$\tan \angle BAP = \frac{50}{60 * t}$

Since we know that the time it takes for the ship to reach point B is $\frac{2}{3}$ hours, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$\tan \angle BAP = \frac{50}{60 * \frac{2}{3}}$

Now, we can simplify the equation:

$\tan \angle BAP = \frac{50}{40}$

$\tan \angle BAP = \frac{5}{4}$

Now, we can find the angle $\angle BAP$ using the tangent function:

$\angle BAP = \arctan(\frac{5}{4})$

$\angle BAP = 53.13$

Now, we can find the angle $\angle BAP$ in degrees:

$\angle BAP = 53.13 * \frac{180}{\pi}$

$\angle BAP = 53.13 * 57.29$

$\angle BAP = 300.0$

Now, we can find the angle $\angle BAP$ in degrees:

Choices:
(A) 3

(C) 9
(D) 12"," Solution:
The diagonal AC is 3.0, and the angle BAD is 120.0. The length of the diagonal BD is equal to the length of the side BC, so BD = BC = 3.0. The perimeter of the diamond is the sum of the lengths of the sides, so the perimeter is 3.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 = 9.0. Therefore, the answer is C.

The given angles are $4x + 11°$ and $8x + 1°$.
We know that if two lines are parallel, then the corresponding angles are equal.
So,
$4x + 11° = 8x + 1°$
$4x = 8x + 1°$
$4x - 8x = 1°$
$-4x = 1°$
$x = \frac{1°}{-4} = -\frac{1}{4}$

Choices:
(A) 35°
(B) 50°
(C) 40°
(D) 60°"," Solution:
Since ∠ACD = 40.0, we can use the property that the angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the diameter at the center.
Therefore, ∠ACO = 2 * 40.0 = 80.0.
Since ∠ACO = 80.0, we can use the property that the angle subtended by an angle at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the angle at the circumference.
Therefore, ∠BAD = 2 * 80.0 = 160.0.
