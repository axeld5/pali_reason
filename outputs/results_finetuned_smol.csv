Question: At time $t=0$ a tank contains $Q_0 \mathrm{lb}$ of salt dissolved in 100 gal of water; see Figure 2.3.1. Assume that water containing $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{lb}$ of salt/gal is entering the tank at a rate of $r \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min}$ and that the well-stirred mixture is draining from the tank at the same rate. Set up the initial value problem that describes this flow process. By finding the amount of salt $Q(t)$ in the tank at any time, and the limiting amount $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time, if $r=3$ and $Q_0=2 Q_L$, find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \%$ of $Q_L$."," Let $Q(t)$ be the amount of salt in the tank at time $t$. The rate of salt entering the tank is $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$, and the rate of salt leaving the tank is $r \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min}$. The initial condition is $Q(0)=Q_0$. The differential equation is
\[\frac{d Q}{d t}=\frac{1}{4} Q-\frac{r}{100} Q\]
The initial condition is $Q(0)=Q_0$. The solution to this differential equation is
\[Q(t)=\frac{Q_0}{1+4 r t / 100}\]
The limiting amount of salt $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time is
\[Q_L=\frac{Q_0}{1+4 r t / 100}\]
To find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \%$ of $Q_L$, we need to find the value of $T$ such that
\[Q(T)=\frac{Q_0}{1+4 r T / 100}+0.02 Q_0\]
Solving for $T$, we get
\[T=\frac{100}{4 r}=\frac{100}{3}=\frac{100}{3} \mathrm{gal}\]
The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{100}{3}}$.",130.4

Choices:

Let's denote the midpoint of AB as M and the midpoint of AC as N.

Since ∠ABC = 90°, we have AM = MB and AN = CN.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BFM:
BF^2 = BM^2 + MF^2

Let's denote the area of △ABC as A, the area of △ABE as B, and the area of △ADE as C.
Given that the area of △ABE is 2, we can write the equation:
B = (1/2) * AE * BE
Since E is the midpoint of AD, we have:
AE = 2 * BE
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
B = (1/2) * 2 * BE
B = BE
Since △ABE is a right triangle, we have:
B = (1/2) * AB * BE
Since AD is the midline of △ABC, we have:
AB = 2 * AD
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
B = (1/2) * 2 * AD * BE
B = 2 * AD * BE
Since the area of △ADE is 2, we have:
C = (1/2) * AD * DE
Since E is the midpoint of AD, we have:
DE = 2 * AD
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
C = 2 * AD * 2 * BE
C = 4 * AD * BE
Since the area of △ABC is equal to the sum of the areas of △ABE and △ADE, we have:
A = B + C
A = 2 + 4
A = 6

Given that point O is the center of circle O, points A, B, and C are on circle O, and AO is parallel to BC.
We know that angle AOB = 40 degrees.
Since AO is parallel to BC, we can use the alternate interior angles theorem.
The angle between AO and BC is equal to the angle between BC and the tangent line at point C.
Let the angle between AO and BC be x degrees.
Since AO is parallel to BC, the angle between BC and the tangent line at point C is also x degrees.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
So, the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.
The sum of the angles in triangle AOB is 180 degrees.

Also, by the property of tangents, we have
\frac{y}{3} = \frac{z - 12}{12}
\Rightarrow y = \frac{3}{12}z - \frac{12}{12} = \frac{1}{4}z - 1
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{4}z = y + 1
\Rightarrow z = 4y + 4
\Rightarrow z = 4(\frac{1}{4}z) + 4

Choices:
(A) 90
(B) 100
(C) 110
(D) 120"," Since $m∠ABC = 70°$, we have $m\widehat{A C} = 360° - m\widehat{A D C} = 360° - x$.
Since $m\widehat{A D C} = 2x$, we have $m\widehat{A C} = 360° - 2x$.
Therefore, $360° - x = 360° - 2x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 120$.

Question: In the figure above, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with center O and diameter AC. If AB = AO, what is the degree measure of angle ABO?
Choices:
(A) 15*\degree
(B) 30*\degree
(C) 45*\degree
(D) 60*\degree
(E) 90*\degree"," Solution:
Let's denote the center of the circle as point O. Since AB = AO, we can conclude that triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle.

Since triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle, we can apply the property that the angle opposite to the equal sides in an isosceles triangle are equal.

Therefore, angle ABO = angle AOB.

Now, we need to find the degree measure of angle ABO.

Let's denote the degree measure of angle ABO as x.

Since the sum of the degrees of an angle and its complementary angle is 90, we have:

x + (90 - x) = 180

Solving for x, we get:

x + 90 - x = 180
90 = 180 - x
x = 90 - 180
x = -90

Since the degree measure of an angle cannot be negative, we take the positive value of x:

x = 90

So, the degree measure of angle ABO is 90.

The correct option is (B).

Choices:
(A) 40°
(B) 50°
(C) 60°
(D) 20°"," Solution:

Let's denote the center of the circle as point O. Since AB is the diameter, angle BOC = 180° - angle BAC = 180° - 80° = 100°.

Now, we have a tangent line AE that intersects the diameter AB at point A. Since AE is tangent to the circle, angle AOC = angle AOB = 80°.

We also have a tangent line AC that intersects the diameter AB at point C. Since AC is tangent to the circle, angle ACB = angle AOB = 80°.

Now, we need to find the angle ADB. Since angle AOC = angle AOB, we can say that angle AOC = angle AOB = 80°.

Since angle AOC = angle AOB = 80°, we can say that angle ADB = 180° - angle AOC - angle AOB = 180° - 80° - 80° = 40°.

Therefore, the degree of angle ADB is 40°.

Question: For trapezoid ABCD shown above, AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16. What is the length of segment CD?"," Let's denote the lengths of the sides of the trapezoid as AB, AD, BC, and CD. We are given that AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16. We need to find the length of CD.

We can use the property of trapezoids that the sum of the lengths of the two bases (parallel sides) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two lateral sides (non-parallel sides). In this case, the bases are AB and AD, and the lateral sides are BC and CD.

The sum of the lengths of the bases is:
AB + AD = 24 + 23 = 47

The sum of the lengths of the lateral sides is:
BC + CD = 16 + CD = 16 + CD

Now, we can set up the equation:
47 = 16 + CD

Subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:
47 - 16 = CD

Calculate the difference:
31 = CD

So, the length of segment CD is 31.

Given:
- D and E are points on the edges AB and AC of △ABC

- AE = 2

To find: AC

Proof:
- Since DE ∥ BC, we can use the property of similar triangles to find the length of AC.
- Let the length of AB be x.
- Since AD:DB = 1:3, we can write AD = 1x and DB = 3x.
- Since AE = 2, we can write AE = 2x.
- By the property of similar triangles, AD/DB = AE/AC.
- Substituting the values, we have 1x/3x = 2x/AC.
- Solving for AC, we get AC = 6x.
- Since AE = 2, we have x = 2.

Question: As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, point C is a point on ⊙O, ∠C = 20.0, then the degree of ∠BOC is ()
Choices:
(A) 20°
(B) 30°
(C) 40°
(D) 60°"," Solution:

Given:
- AB is the diameter of circle O.
- Point C is a point on circle O.
- ∠C = 20°.

To find:
- The degree of ∠BOC.

Proof:
- Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90°).
- The angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at the circumference.
- Therefore, ∠ACB = 2∠BAC.
- Given that ∠C = 20°, we can write:
∠ACB = 2 * 20° = 40°.
- Since AB is the diameter, ∠BAC = 90°.
- Therefore, ∠BAC = 90°.
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.
- Therefore, ∠BAC + ∠BOC + ∠C = 180°.
- Substituting the values of ∠BAC and ∠C, we get:
90° + ∠BOC + 20° = 180°.
- Solving for ∠BOC:
∠BOC = 180° - 90° - 20° = 70°.

Answer:
- The degree of ∠BOC is 70°.

Choices:
(A) 8
(B) 10
(C) 12
(D) 14"," Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of the sides of △ABC as a, b, and c. We are given that the length of the side DE is 6.

Since DE is the midpoint of AB, we have:
DE = 6

Now, we can find the lengths of the other sides of △BDE. Since DE is the midpoint of AB, we have:
BD = DE = 6

Since △BDE is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse BC. The lengths of the other two sides are BD and DE, which are both 6.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
BC^2 = BD^2 + DE^2
BC^2 = 6^2 + 6^2
BC^2 = 36 + 36
BC^2 = 72

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
BC = √72
BC ≈ 8.48

Now, we can find the length of the hypotenuse AC using the Pythagorean theorem. The lengths of the other two sides of △ABC are a and b, and the length of the hypotenuse is BC.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
AC^2 = a^2 + 8.48^2
AC^2 = a^2 + 71.92

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)

Since the question asks for the length of the hypotenuse AC, we can find it by taking the square root of the expression we found earlier.

AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)

Now, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse AC. Since the lengths of the other two sides of △ABC are a and b, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
AC^2 = a^2 + 8.48^2
AC^2 = a^2 + 71.92

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)

Since the question asks for the length of the hypotenuse AC, we can find it by taking the square root of the expression we found earlier.

AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)

Now, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse AC. Since the lengths of the other two sides of △ABC are a and b, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
AC^2 = a^2 + 8.48^2
AC^2 = a^2 + 71.92

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)

Since the question asks for the length of the hypotenuse AC, we can find it by taking the square root of the expression we found earlier.

AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)
AC ≈ √(a^2 + 71.92)

Now, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse AC. Since the lengths of the other two sides of △ABC are a and b, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2

Question: 如图，在Rt△ABC中，∠BAC＝90°，以Rt△ABC的三边为边分别向外作等边三角形△A'BC，△AB'C，△ABC'，若△A'BC，△AB'C的面积分别是10和4，则△ABC'的面积是（）
Choices:
(A) 4
(B) 6
(C) 8
(D) 9"," Let's denote the side lengths of △ABC as a, b, and c. We are given that ∠BAC = 90°.

We can use the property of the angle bisector of a triangle to find the lengths of the sides of △ABC. The angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.

Let the lengths of the sides of △ABC be a, b, and c. We can write the following proportion:

(a + b) / c = c / a

Since ∠BAC = 90°, we have a = b. So, the proportion becomes:

(a + a) / c = c / a
2a / c = c / a

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for a:

2a^2 = c^2
a^2 = c^2 / 2
a = √(c^2 / 2)

We are given that the area of △A'BC is 10, so we can write:

(1/2) * (a + b) * h = 10
(1/2) * (√(c^2 / 2)) * h = 10
h = 20 / √(c^2 / 2)

Similarly, we are given that the area of △AB'C is 4, so we can write:

(1/2) * (a + b) * h = 4
(1/2) * (√(c^2 / 2)) * h = 4
h = 8 / √(c^2 / 2)

Now, we can set the two heights equal to each other:

20 / √(c^2 / 2) = 8 / √(c^2 / 2)

Divide both sides by √(c^2 / 2):

20 / 8 = √(c^2 / 2) / √(c^2 / 2)
5 / 2 = 1 / √(c^2 / 2)

Now, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:

25 = c^2 / 2
c^2 = 50
c = √50

Now, we can find the area of △ABC:

Area = (1/2) * (a + b) * h
Area = (1/2) * (√(c^2 / 2)) * (20 / √(c^2 / 2))
Area = (1/2) * (√50) * (20 / √50)
Area = 10

The area of △ABC is 10, which is not given in the choices. Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

Let's check the given options:
(A) 4
(B) 6
(C) 8
(D) 9

The area of △ABC is 10, which is not one of the given choices. Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

The correct answer is:
(A) 4

The area of △ABC is 10, which is not one of the given choices. Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

Choices:
(A) 26°
(B) 28°
(C) 30°
(D) 34°"," Since △ABC ≅ △DEF, we know that AB = DE, AC = DF, and BC = EF.
Given that CD is the bisector of ∠BCA, we have ∠BCA = 2∠BCD.
We are given that ∠A = 22° and ∠CGF = 88°.
Let ∠C = x. Then, ∠CGF = 88° - x.
Since ∠A = 22°, we have ∠C + ∠A = 180° - ∠C.
Substituting the given values, we have x + 22° = 180° - x.
Combining like terms, we get 2x = 158°.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 79°.
Since ∠C = x, we have ∠C = 79°.
Since ∠C = ∠CGF, we have ∠C + ∠CGF = 180°.
Substituting the given values, we have 79° + 88° = 167°.
Since ∠BCA = 2∠BCD, we have ∠BCA = 2 * 79° = 158°.
Since ∠BCA = ∠BCD, we have ∠BCD = 158°.
Since ∠BCA = ∠E, we have ∠E = 158°.
The answer is: A",26°

Choices:
(A) 3
(B) 4
(C) 5
(D) 6"," Let $P$ be the point where the perpendicular bisector of $QR$ intersects the $x$-axis. Then, $P$ has coordinates $(7, 0)$.
Let $Q$ be the point where the perpendicular bisector of $PR$ intersects the $x$-axis. Then, $Q$ has coordinates $(0, 4)$.
Let $R$ be the point where the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ intersects the $y$-axis. Then, $R$ has coordinates $(0, 7)$.
Now, we can use the fact that the perpendicular bisectors of a triangle are concurrent.
Let $O$ be the point where the perpendicular bisectors of $PQ$, $PR$, and $QR$ intersect. Then, $O$ has coordinates $(0, 0)$.
We can use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
The length of $PQ$ is $\sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 16} = \sqrt{65} = 5.09$.
The length of $PR$ is $\sqrt{(0 - 7)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 16} = \sqrt{65} = 5.09$.
The length of $QR$ is $\sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 16} = \sqrt{65} = 5.09$.
The lengths of the sides of the triangle are all equal, so the triangle is equilateral.
Therefore, the coordinates of $O$ are $(0, 0)$.
Now, we can use the fact that the distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.
The distance from $P$ to the line $2x = 7$ is $7 - 0 = 7$.
The distance from $Q$ to the line $2x = 7$ is $0 - 0 = 0$.
The distance from $R$ to the line $2x = 7$ is $0 - 0 = 0$.

(C) 14.2
(D) 44.3"," The diagram shows a triangle with vertices A, B, and C. The lengths of the sides of the triangle are 16, 97, and 21.

We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the side opposite to the angle opposite to the angle B.

Let the length of the side opposite to the angle B be x.

Using the Law of Cosines, we have:

x^2 = 16^2 + 97^2 - 2 * 16 * 97 * cos(B)

x^2 = 256 + 9409 - 2872 * cos(B)

x^2 = 11965 - 2872 * cos(B)

x^2 = 11965 - 2872 * (97/100)

x^2 = 11965 - 2824.94

x^2 = 9720.06

x = √9720.06

x ≈ 98.5

Now, we can find the angle opposite to the side opposite to the angle B.

Using the Law of Cosines again, we have:

cos(B) = (16^2 + 97^2 - 2 * 16 * 97 * x) / (2 * 16 * 97)

cos(B) = (256 + 9409 - 2872x) / (3084)

cos(B) = (9665 - 2872x) / 3084

cos(B) = 2.66

B = arccos(2.66)

B = 76.06

Now, we can find the angle opposite to the side opposite to the angle C.

Using the Law of Cosines again, we have:

cos(C) = (16^2 + 21^2 - 2 * 16 * 21 * x) / (2 * 16 * 21)

cos(C) = (256 + 441 - 672x) / 672

cos(C) = (697 - 672x) / 672

cos(C) = 0.9999999999999999

C = arccos(0.9999999999999999)

C = 0

Since the angle opposite to the side opposite to the angle C is 0, the triangle is a right triangle.

The length of the hypotenuse is 16, and the length of the side opposite to the angle C is 0.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

(16)^2 + 0^2 = (hypotenuse)^2

So, the hypotenuse is 16.

The length of the side opposite to the angle B is x, and the length of the hypotenuse is 16.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

x^2 + 16^2 = 16^2

x^2 = 16^2 - 16^2

x^2 = 0

x = 0

Now, we can find the length of the side opposite to the angle B.

Using the Law of Cosines, we have:

cos(B) = (16^2 + 97^2 - 2 * 16 * 97 * x) / (2 * 16 * 97)

cos(B) = (256 + 9409 - 2872x) / (3084)

cos(B) = (9665 - 2872x) / 3084

cos(B) = 2.66

B = arccos(2.66)

B = 76.06

Now, we can find the angle opposite to the side opposite to the angle C.

Using the Law of Cosines again, we have:

cos(C) = (16^2 + 21^2 - 2 * 16 * 2",5.8

Choices:
(A) 32°

(D) 30°"," Solution:
Let's denote the length of the hypotenuse of the original triangle as BC, and the length of the side opposite to the angle BAC as AC.
Since ∠BAC = 90°, we have AC = BC.
Now, we rotate the triangle counterclockwise by 90° around point A. This means that the angle between the original side BC and the rotated side AB′ is 90°.
We are given that ∠CC′B′ = 32°. Since the rotation is clockwise, we can conclude that ∠CC′B′ = 180° - ∠BAC.
Therefore, ∠BAC = 90°, and ∠CC′B′ = 180° - 90° = 90°.
Since the rotation is clockwise, the angle between the original side BC and the rotated side AB′ is 90°.
Therefore, the size of ∠AC′B′ is 90°.

Question: At 9.0 in the morning, a ship departs from point A and sails in the direction due east at a speed of 40.0 nautical miles per hour, and arrives at point B at 9.0 and 30.0 minutes. As shown in the figure, the island M is measured from A and B. In the direction of 45.0 north by east and 15.0 north by east, then the distance between B and island M is ()
Choices:
(A) 20海里
(B) 20√{2}海里
(C) 15海里
(D) 20海里"," Answer: B

Solution:

Let's denote the distance between point A and point B as AB. The ship travels from point A to point B at a speed of 40 nautical miles per hour. The time taken to travel from point A to point B is given as 9.0 hours and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 9.0 hours and 150 minutes.

The speed of the ship is given as 40 nautical miles per hour. To find the distance between point A and point B, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

First, we need to convert the time from hours and minutes to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Time in minutes = 9.0 hours + 150 minutes
Time in minutes = 9.0 × 60 + 150
Time in minutes = 540 + 150
Time in minutes = 690 minutes

Now, we can calculate the distance using the speed and time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 40 nautical miles/hour × 690 minutes
Distance = 40 × 690
Distance = 27600 nautical miles

Now, we need to convert the distance from nautical miles to miles. There are 1.15 nautical miles in a mile, so:

Distance in miles = 27600 × 1.15
Distance in miles = 30360 miles

The distance between point A and point B is 30360 nautical miles.

Now, let's find the angle between the direction of 45.0 north by east and the direction of 15.0 north by east.

The angle between the two directions is the difference between the bearings. The bearing of the direction of 45.0 north by east is 45°, and the bearing of the direction of 15.0 north by east is 15°. The difference between these bearings is:

45° - 15° = 30°

Now, we can find the angle between the direction of 45.0 north by east and the direction of 15.0 north by east using the difference in bearings:

Angle = 30°

Now, we need to find the distance between point B and island M. The angle between the direction of 45.0 north by east and the direction of 15.0 north by east is 30°. The distance between point B and island M is 27600 nautical miles.

We can use the sine rule to find the distance between point B and island M:

sin(angle) / distance = sin(angle) / distance
sin(30°) / 27600 = sin(angle) / distance
sin(30°) / 27600 = sin(angle) / 27600

Now, we can solve for the angle:

sin(angle) = 27600 × sin(30°) / 27600
sin(angle) = 27600 × 0.5 / 27600
sin(angle) = 13800 / 27600
sin(angle) = 0.5

Now, we can find the angle:

angle = arcsin(0.5)
angle = 30°

Now, we can find the distance between point B and island M using the sine rule:

sin(angle) / distance = sin(angle) / distance
0.5 / distance = 0.5 / 27600
0.5 / distance = 1 / 55200

Now, we can solve for the distance:

distance = 0.5 × 55200
distance = 27600

The distance between point B and island M is 27600 nautical miles.

Now, we need to convert the distance from nautical miles to miles. There are 1.15 nautical miles in a mile, so:

Distance in miles = 27600 × 1.15
Distance in miles = 30360 miles

The distance between point B and island M is 30360 nautical miles.

Comparing the distances, we can see that:

Distance between point A and point B = 27600 nautical miles
Distance between point B and island M = ",20√{2}海里

Use the figure to estimate the normal components of $\mathbf{a}$."," The magnitude of the acceleration vector is $10 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}^2$. The acceleration vector is pointing in the positive $x$-direction. The normal components of the acceleration vector are the projections of the acceleration vector onto the $x$- and $y$-axes. The projection of the acceleration vector onto the $x$-axis is the magnitude of the acceleration vector times the cosine of the angle between the acceleration vector and the $x$-axis. The angle between the acceleration vector and the $x$-axis is $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the projection of the acceleration vector onto the $x$-axis is $10 \cos \frac{\pi}{2}=0$. The projection of the acceleration vector onto the $y$-axis is the magnitude of the acceleration vector times the sine of the angle between the acceleration vector and the $y$-axis. The angle between the acceleration vector and the $y$-axis is $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the projection of the acceleration vector onto the $y$-axis is $10 \sin \frac{\pi}{2}=10$.

The tangent at A makes an angle of 4 with the radius OA.
The tangent at B makes an angle of 6 with the radius OB.
The tangent at C makes an angle of 8 with the radius OC.
The tangent at D makes an angle of 10 with the radius OD.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180.
Therefore, angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 180.

Question: As shown in the figure, in ▱ABCD, the diagonal AC and BD intersect at point O, if AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0, AB = 7.0, then the perimeter of △OAB is ()
Choices:
(A) 15
(B) 17
(C) 21
(D) 27"," Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of AB, AC, and BC as a, b, and c, respectively.
We are given that AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0, and AB = 7.0.
We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the other sides of the triangle.
Since AC and BD intersect at point O, we can use the lengths of the sides of the rectangle to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
Let's denote the length of the side of the rectangle as x.
The diagonal of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circumcircle of the triangle.
The circumradius of a triangle is given by the formula:
R = (abc) / (4A)
where A is the area of the triangle.
We are given the lengths of the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, but we don't have the area.
However, we can use the lengths of the sides of the rectangle to find the area of the triangle.
The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
A = (ab) / 2
We are given that AC = 12.0 and BD = 8.0, so we can find the area of the rectangle as:
A = (12.0 * 8.0) / 2 = 96.0 / 2 = 48.0
Now, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:
A = (ab) / 2
We are given that the area is 48.0, so we can write:
48.0 = (12.0 * 8.0) / 2
Simplifying, we get:
48.0 = 32.0
This is not correct.
The area of the triangle is not 48.0.
Therefore, the perimeter of △OAB is not 15.

Since $\angle CHK = 83^\circ$, we have $\angle KJH = 83^\circ$.
Since $\angle KJH = 83^\circ$, we have $\angle KHJ = 90^\circ - 83^\circ = 7^\circ$.
Since $\angle KHJ = 7^\circ$, we have $\angle KHG = 180^\circ - 7^\circ = 173^\circ$.
Since $\angle KHG = 173^\circ$, we have $\angle GHK = 180^\circ - 173^\circ = 7^\circ$.
Since $\angle GHK = 7^\circ$, we have $\angle HGK = 180^\circ - 7^\circ = 173^\circ$.
Since $\angle HGK = 173^\circ$, we have $\angle HGK = \angle GHK = 173^\circ$.
Since $\angle HGK = \angle GHK = 173^\circ$, we have $\overline{GH} \parallel \overline{KJ}$.
Since $\overline{GH} \parallel \overline{KJ}$, we have $\angle GHK = \angle KJH$.

Choices:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 2√{2}
(D) √{6}"," Solution:
Let's denote the center of the circle as O. Since AB = BC, we have AO = BO. Since AB is the hypotenuse of the triangle AOB, we have AO = 4. Therefore, OB = 4.

Now, we have a right triangle AOB with hypotenuse AB and one of its sides equal to 4. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other side, OB.

Let x be the length of OB. Then, we have:
AB^2 = AO^2 + OB^2
4^2 = 4^2 + x^2
16 = 16 + x^2
x^2 = 0
x = 0

Since OB is the hypotenuse of the triangle AOB, OB cannot be equal to 0. Therefore, there is no such triangle.

The question asks for the length of AC, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle AOC. Since the center of the circle is D, the center of the circle is also the center of the triangle AOC. Therefore, the length of AC is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle AOC.

The hypotenuse of the triangle AOC is the diameter of the circle, which is equal to 4. Therefore, the length of AC is 4.

The question asks for the length of AC, which is 4. Therefore, the correct option is (C).

Question: Find $x$.
Choices:
(A) 3
(B) 4
(C) 6
(D) 7"," Let the center of the circle be $O$.
The center of the circle lies on the line $6x + 2 = 8$, so $x = \frac{6}{6} = 1$.
The radius of the circle is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle with vertices $O$, $A$, and $B$.
The lengths of the two sides of the triangle are $9$ and $2$, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{9^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{81 + 4} = \sqrt{85} = 9.21$.
The radius of the circle is $\frac{9.21}{2} = 4.605$.
The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diameter is $2 \times 4.605 = 9.21$.
The diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the triangle with length $10$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{D}$.

Question: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.
Choices:
(A) 32
(B) 39
(C) 46
(D) 78"," To find the perimeter of the parallelogram, we need to know the lengths of its sides. The given information is:
- The length of one side is 23 ft.
- The length of the other side is 16 ft.
- The angle between the two sides is 60°.

Using the properties of a parallelogram, we know that opposite sides are equal in length and opposite angles are equal.

Let's denote the lengths of the two sides as a and b. According to the properties of a parallelogram, we have:
- a = 23 ft
- b = 16 ft

The angle between the two sides is 60°. We can use the sine function to find the length of the diagonal (the hypotenuse of the parallelogram):

sin(60°) = (opposite side / hypotenuse)
sin(60°) = (a / hypotenuse)

We know that a = 23 ft, so:

sin(60°) = (23 / hypotenuse)

Now, we can find the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite to the 60° angle):

hypotenuse = a / sin(60°)
hypotenuse = 23 / sin(60°)

Using a calculator, we find:

hypotenuse ≈ 23 / 0.87
hypotenuse ≈ 26.46

Now, we can find the perimeter of the parallelogram by adding the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2 * (side1 + side2)
Perimeter = 2 * (23 + 16)
Perimeter = 2 * 39
Perimeter = 78

So, the perimeter of the parallelogram is 78 ft.

(C)

Hint:

The given information is:

(A) 5.4
(B) 6
(C) 6.6
(D) 7.5

We know that the triangle RWS is a right triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse (WS) and the length of the side opposite to the right angle (RW).

WS^2 = RW^2 + RQ^2
6^2 = RW^2 + 5^2

Choices:
(A) \frac{15}{4}cm
(B) \frac{20}{3}cm
(C) \frac{15}{7}cm
(D) \frac{20}{7}cm"," Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle as AB, AC, and AD. We are given that DE is parallel to BC.

We can use the properties of similar triangles to find the length of DE.

Since DE is parallel to BC, we can use the corresponding sides of similar triangles.

Let the length of DE be x. Then, the length of BC is 7.0 - x.

The length of AC is 5.0.

The length of AD is 3.0.

We can set up the proportion:

\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{DE}{BC}
\frac{7.0 - x}{5.0} = \frac{x}{7.0 - x}

Cross-multiply:
7.0 - x = 5.0x
6.0x = 7.0
x = \frac{7.0}{6.0}
x = \frac{15}{4}

So, the length of DE is \frac{15}{4} cm.

Choices:
(A) 1
(B) √{3}
(C) 2
(D) 3"," Solution:
Let's denote the radius of the circle as r. We are given that the length of the chord PA is 4 units and the angle subtended by the chord at the center of the circle is 30°.

Using the property of tangents to a circle, we know that the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the center of the circle. Therefore, the angle subtended by the chord PA at the center of the circle is also 30°.

Now, we can use the property of tangents to find the length of the radius of the circle. The length of the tangent segment PA is equal to the length of the radius of the circle, as the tangents are perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact.

Let the radius of the circle be r units. The length of the tangent segment PA is 4 units. Therefore, we have:

PA = r

We are given that the angle subtended by the chord PA at the center of the circle is 30°. Therefore, the angle subtended by the chord PA at the center of the circle is 30°.

Now, we can use the property of tangents to find the length of the radius of the circle. The angle subtended by the chord PA at the center of the circle is 30°. Therefore, the angle subtended by the chord PA at the center of the circle is 30°.

Using the property of tangents, we have:

PA = r

We are given that the length of the chord PA is 4 units. Therefore, we have:

4 = r

Therefore, the length of the radius of the circle is 4 units.

The answer is: 4",2

Choices:
(A) 25°
(B) 40°
(C) 50°
(D) 65°"," Solution:
The tangent point C lies on the extended line of AB, which is the diameter of the circle ⊙O. Since the diameter of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent, the angle between the tangent and the diameter is 90°.

Given that ∠A = 25°, we can use the property that the angle between the tangent and the diameter is 90°.

Since ∠A = 25°, we have ∠O = 90° - ∠A = 90° - 25° = 65°.

Now, we need to find the angle ∠D.

Since ∠D is the angle between the tangent and the diameter, we can use the property that the angle between the tangent and the diameter is equal to the angle between the tangent and the chord.

The angle between the tangent and the diameter is 65°, and the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle between the tangent and the diameter.

Therefore, ∠D = ∠O = 65°.

The correct option is (D).

Question: 如图，△ABC中，N是BC边上的中点，AM平分∠BAC，BM⊥AM于点M，若AB＝8，MN＝2．则AC的长为（）
Choices:
(A) 10
(B) 11
(C) 12
(D) 13"," Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of AB, AC, and BC as a, b, and c, respectively. We are given that MN = 2 and AM is the midpoint of BC.

Since AM is the midpoint of BC, we have:
AM = 1/2 * BC

We are also given that MN = 2. Therefore, we can write:
MN = 2 = 1/2 * BC

Now, we can solve for BC:
BC = 2 * 2 = 4

Since AB = 8, we can find the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
AC^2 = 8^2 + 4^2
AC^2 = 64 + 16
AC^2 = 80
AC = √80
AC = 4√5

Therefore, the length of AC is √5.

The answer is: A",12

Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line a ∥ b, the point B is on the straight line b, and AB ⊥ BC, ∠2 = 65.0, then the degree of ∠1 is ()
Choices:
(A) 65°
(B) 25°
(C) 35°
(D) 45°"," Solution:
Let's denote the angle at point B as ∠1.
We know that AB is perpendicular to BC, so ∠1 + ∠2 = 90.
We also know that ∠2 = 65.0.
Substituting the value of ∠2 into the equation, we have:
∠1 + 65.0 = 90.0.
Subtracting 65.0 from both sides, we get:
∠1 = 90.0 - 65.0.
∠1 = 25.0.
The answer is: B",25°

Choices:
(A) 3
(B) 6
(C) 9
(D) 12"," Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of the sides of the diamond as AD, AB, and BC. We are given that ∠BAD = 120.0 and the length of the diagonal AC = 3.0.

Since ∠BAD = 120.0, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the side BD. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite to side c, the equation is:

c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)

In this case, we have:

BD² = AD² + AB² - 2 * AD * AB * cos(∠BAD)

BD² = 3² + 3² - 2 * 3 * 3 * cos(120.0)
BD² = 9 + 9 - 18 * (0.5)
BD² = 18 - 9
BD² = 9

Now, we can find the length of BD by taking the square root of BD²:

BD = √9
BD = 3

Now, we can find the lengths of the other sides of the diamond. Since the perimeter of the diamond is the sum of the lengths of its sides, we can find the lengths of AB and BC:

Perimeter = AD + AB + BC
Perimeter = 3 + AB + BC

We know that ∠BAD = 120.0 and the length of the diagonal AC = 3.0. We can use the Law of Cosines again to find the length of BC:

BC² = AC² - AB² + 2 * AC * AB * cos(∠BAD)

BC² = 3² - 3² + 2 * 3 * 3 * cos(120.0)
BC² = 9 - 9 + 18 * (0.5)
BC² = 9 - 9 + 9
BC² = 9

Now, we can find the length of BC by taking the square root:

BC = √9
BC = 3

Now, we can find the lengths of the sides of the diamond:

AD = 3
AB = 3
BC = 3

The perimeter of the diamond is the sum of the lengths of its sides:

Perimeter = AD + AB + BC
Perimeter = 3 + 3 + 3
Perimeter = 9

The angle at the center of the circle is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same chord.
The angle at the center of the circle is 2 * 70.0 = 140.0.
The angle at the circumference subtended by the same chord is equal to half the angle at the center.
The angle at the circumference subtended by the chord AB is 140.0 / 2 = 70.0.
The angle at the circumference subtended by the chord AC is 70.0 / 2 = 35.0.

Choices:
(A) \frac{2}{3}
(B) \frac{1}{4}
(C) \frac{1}{3}
(D) \frac{1}{2}"," Solution:
Since DE ∥ BC, we can use the property of similar triangles to find the ratio of the corresponding sides.
Let AD/DB = x, then AE/EC = x.
We are given AD = 1.0 and DB = 2.0.
Substituting these values, we get 1.0/2.0 = x.
Solving for x, we find x = 0.5.
Now, we can find the ratio of AD/DB = 1.0/2.0 = 0.5.
Since AD/DB = x, we can write x = \frac{1.0}{2.0} = \frac{1}{2}.
Therefore, the value of \frac ADAB is \frac{1}{2}.

Question: The measure of angle BAC equals x*\degree. What is the value of x?"," The measure of angle BAC is x*\degree. To find the value of x, we can use the property that the sum of the degrees of an angle and its complementary angle is 90. The complementary angle of x*\degree is 90-x*\degree. Therefore, the sum of the degrees of angle BAC and its complementary angle is 90.

Let's denote the degrees of angle BAC and its complementary angle as x*\degree and (90-x)*\degree, respectively.

According to the property, the sum of the degrees of angle BAC and its complementary angle is 90. So, we have:

x*\degree + (90-x)*\degree = 90

Combining like terms, we get:

x*\degree + 90 - x*\degree = 90

Simplifying, we have:

90 - x*\degree = 90

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

-x*\degree = 0

Dividing both sides by -1, we find:

x*\degree = 0

Since x*\degree represents the degree of angle BAC, the value of x is 0.

Final answer: The value of x is 0.",30

Choices:
(A) 19
(B) 16
(C) 29
(D) 18"," Solution:
Let's denote the lengths of AB, AC, and BC as a, b, and c, respectively. We are given that AB = 6 and the length of AE is 13.

Since AD is the perpendicular bisector of BC, we have:
BD = DC = BC/2 = 3

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AD:
AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2
AD^2 = 6^2 + 3^2
AD^2 = 36 + 9
AD^2 = 45

Now, we can find the length of AD:
AD = √45 = 7√5

The perimeter of △ABC is given by:
Perimeter = AB + AC + BC
Perimeter = 6 + a + a + 3
Perimeter = 6 + 2a + 3
Perimeter = 9 + 2a

We are given that the perimeter of △ABC is 13, so we can set up the equation:
9 + 2a = 13

Now, we solve for a:
2a = 13 - 9
2a = 4
a = 4/2
a = 2

Now, we can find the length of AB:
AB = 6

Finally, we can find the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
AC^2 = 6^2 + 3^2
AC^2 = 36 + 9
AC^2 = 45

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = √45 = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC using the Pythagorean theorem:
BC^2 = AC^2 + AB^2
BC^2 = (3√5)^2 + 3^2
BC^2 = 45 + 9
BC^2 = 54

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = √54 = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AD:
AD = 7√5

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AB:
AB = 6

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AD:
AD = 7√5

Now, we can find the length of AB:
AB = 6

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AD:
AD = 7√5

Now, we can find the length of AB:
AB = 6

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AD:
AD = 7√5

Now, we can find the length of AB:
AB = 6

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AD:
AD = 7√5

AB = 6

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Now, we can find the length of AC:
AC = 3√5

Now, we can find the length of BC:
BC = 3√6

Since DE is the internal bisector of ∠ADC, we can use the property that the length of the internal bisector of an angle is equal to the length of the median drawn from the vertex of the angle to the opposite side of the angle.
Let BE be the length of the internal bisector of ∠ADC.
Since AD = 6 and AB = 4, we can use the property that the length of the median drawn from the vertex of the angle to the opposite side of the angle is equal to the length of the bisector of the angle.
Therefore, BE = AD/2 = 6/2 = 3.
The correct option is B.

Use the Midpoint Rule to estimate the area of the wing's cross-section."," The midpoints of the intervals are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, and 110. The corresponding heights are 20.3, 26.7, 29.0, 27.6, 27.3, 23.8, 20.5, 15.1, 8.7, 2.8, and 2.8. The area of the wing's cross-section is approximately 10 * (20.3 + 26.7 + 29.0 + 27.6 + 27.3 + 23.8 + 20.5 + 15.1 + 8.7 + 2.8 + 2.8) = 10 * 170.6 = 1706.0. Therefore, the answer is 1706.",4232

Question: 如图：∠AOB：∠BOC：∠COD＝2：3：4，射线OM、ON，分别平分∠AOB与∠COD，又∠MON＝84°，则∠AOB为（）
Choices:
(A) 28°
(B) 30°
(C) 32°
(D) 38°"," 射线OM、ON分别平分∠AOB与∠COD，则∠AOM＝∠OON＝x，∠AOB＝2x，∠COD＝3x
